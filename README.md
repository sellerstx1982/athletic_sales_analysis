# Athletic Sales Analysis
My coding project uses Pandas to combine, clean, and sort data from two CSV files representing athletic sales from the years 2020 and 2021 as resources.

## Process:
To begin, open the athletic_sales_analysis.ipynb file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebook. Each cell has code that displays an output below the individual cell. Use the play button outside the top left corner of each cell to run each cell. You can also click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move down to the next cell. The output of each cell displays what the comment requests and uses the Pandas Library of the Python coding language.

## Summary:
During the project I discovered a few different things about the 2020 and 2021 athletic sales data. First, the region that sold the most products and generated the most sales during both 2020 and 2021 combined was the Northeast Region. Next, the retailer that produced the most sales during the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 was West Gear. West Gear also sold the most Women's Footwear units. And last, I looked at the days and weeks with the most women's athletic footwear sales overall, across all regions and including all retailers. The day with the most women's athletic footwear sales was July 16th, 2021 and the week with the most women's athletic footwear sales was the week beginning on December 19th, 2021.
